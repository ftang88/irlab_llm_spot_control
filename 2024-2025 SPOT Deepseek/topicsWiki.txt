/arm_joint_commands
Publish to this topic to command the joint angles of the arm. The type of the message is sensor_msgs/msg/JointState. It should contain the names [arm_sh0, arm_sh1, arm_el0, arm_el1, arm_wr0, arm_wr1, arm_f1x] and desired positions for each element. (Velocity and effort components of the joint state message are not used!)

/body_pose
Publish to this topic to command the robot's body to move to a desired pose relative to the nominal standing pose without moving its feet. Only the z component of the position component is used. The orientation component will attempt to twist the body.

/cmd_vel
Publish to this topic to command the robot to walk at a given velocity. Only the x and y components of the linear twist are used, and only the z component of the angular twist is used.

/manipulation_state
Reports on if the gripper is open/closed, if the arm is stowed/unstowed, if the arm is carrying anything, and the velocity of the end effector in different frames.

/odometry
Gives the position and velocity of the robot in either the odom or vision frame

/odometry/twist
Gives the velocity of the robot in either the odom or vision frame

/status/battery_states
Reports the status of the battery, including current charge.

/status/behavior_faults
Reports on a list of faults that the robot is currently experiencing. (Ideally this list is empty).

/status/end_effector_force
Reports on the estimated force at the end effector

/status/estop
Reports on the estops that are currently active on the robot.

/status/feedback
Reports on whether the robot is sitting, standing, or moving.

/status/feet
Reports on the location of each foot with respect to the body frame, as well as if each foot is in contact with the floor.

/status/leases
Reports on the status of each lease on the robot, including who owns them.

/status/metrics
Reports on how long the robot has been on and how far it has traveled since then.

/status/mobility_params
Reports on current mobility parameters for the robot -- including if it is in stair mode, and what kind of gait is set.

/status/power_states
Indicates what kind of power state the motors are in (powered, powering on/off, etc)

/status/system_faults
Reports on if there are any active system faults on the robot

/status/wifi
Reports on the wifi connection of the robot
